# My portfolio devXavier

This is my personal portfolio website built using only HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. I then used JAMstack so the site can be served as a static site, this was achieved by using eleventy and up staging the HTML file to a Nunjucks file.

## Below is the link to my portfolio and a preview to the landing page of the website.
